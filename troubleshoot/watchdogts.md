# Troubleshooting

This section provides some troubleshooting tips related to BrowserMon service.

## Initial Checks

1. **Check Port Status**
   If you are experiencing issues with the Watchdog server, the first step is to check the status of the port it is
   supposed to be running on. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:
    - Use netstat to Check Port Status
      ```bash
      netstat -tuln | grep 8900 
      ```
    - Check if Watchdog is listening on the port 8900 and bind to `0.0.0.0`

2. **Logs**

    - Set the `loglevel` to `DEBUG` in conf file.
    - Review the Watchdog logs and the Gunicorn Server logs. Watchdog generates logs in the `logdir` configured in conf
      file:

        - Watchdog Logs
        - Gunicorn Logs

3. **Process Status**

- Check the status of the process if it is running or not.

    - Check if the process is running
      ```bash
      ps aux | grep Watchdog 
      ```
    - Get the details of the process if it's running
      ```bash
      ps -p <pid> -o pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem,etime
      ```
